# Pangea

**Pangea is a Peer-to-Peer Jurisdiction powered by Secure Scuttlebutt and Ethereum.**

 - Private messages are end-to-end encrypted, always.
 - You have to follow somebody to get messages from them, so you won't get spammed.
 - Your mail can be public broadcasts or private, and you'll only see replies by people you follow.
 - The datastructure is a global mesh of append-only logs, which can support new types of data (not just "mail").
 - Users are not bound to one server/host (what we call "pubs") and do not have to trust the servers.
 - It's very easy to setup and maintain your own pub.
 - The software runs on your device, so there's nobody tracking your browsing.
 - The application-code is FOSS, so you're free to fork or write new applications without a gatekeeper setting terms.
 - Data is saved to your disk, and so the application works offline.
 - You can sync directly with friends over the wifi. 

Because we're still in development, **you'll need to contact an SSB or BITNATION team member to get onto the network!**
That's our informal barrier to entry right now, since we're not prepared for lots of users yet.

Pangea embeds the [Scuttlebot networked database](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot) and Patchwork Client, so if you're running Pangea, you don't need to run another scuttlebot server.
